# 1 Introduction

In lab 2 we dug deeper into the testing process as we utilized several testing methods such as Unit Testing and Black Box testing. We were also strongly encouraged to learn the new application, Eclipse, to aid us in the testing process by using JAR files to set up this project in Eclipse. Not only did this lab allow us to further explore new IDEs, but it also helped apply the concepts taught in class such as Equivalence Class Testing and Boundary Class Testing to create partitions. This lab required us to use both concepts to fully test a new application, allowing us to create a structured test suite that thoroughly checked the application from multiple aspects and ensure that we accounted for the domain of the input variable. By using both ECT and Boundary testing, it ensures that coverage is at a maximum and almost every aspect of the application has been checked. In this report we will be exploring how Black Box testing and Unit Testing have helped cover some key aspects of the Range.class and all aspects of the DataUtilities.class.
